# Screen Share Example
This example project shows how you can share local screen while making a Direct Call using Apple's ReplayKit. Local user's camera stream will be replaced with the local screen, and the remote user will be able to see your screen.

This sample uses Apple's `ReplayKit.RPScreenRecorder` to capture and share the app's screen. 

> Currently, sharing the screen of the target app is only available, and screen outside the app will not be shared. 
 
For more information about screen sharing, please take a look at [our documentation](https://sendbird.com/docs/calls/v1/ios/guides/key-functions#2-share-screen).
