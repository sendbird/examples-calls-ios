# Screen Capture Example
This example shows how you can capture local or remote user's video view while making a Direct Call. The captured photo is returned as a `UIImage`  which can be transferred or processed easily. 

> In this example, when the screen is captured, the captured photo is saved to the device's photo album.

For more information about screen capture, please take a look at [our documentation](https://sendbird.com/docs/calls/v1/ios/guides/key-functions#2-capture-video-views).
