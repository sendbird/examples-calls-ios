# Hold And Resume Example
This example project shows how you can implement call holding with Direct Call using Apple's CallKit. You can use CallKit's call hold capability with DirectCall's `hold and resume` feature to allow users to hold an ongoing call before answering another incoming call. 
 
In this sample, you can hold and accept multiple calls, view a list of ongoing calls, and choose any call to unhold. 
 
For more information about call holding, please take a look at [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxsetheldcallaction) and [our documentation](https://sendbird.com/docs/calls/v1/ios/guides/direct-call#2-hold-and-resume-a-call).
